AI is being used in multiple places such as Siri, Google's AlphaGo, AI in Chess playing, etc. Artificial Intelligence applies machine learning, deep learning and other techniques to solve actual problems. 2.Neural Network:A neural network is a kind of machine learning inspired by the workings of the human brain. It’s a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. 3.Deep Learning:  Deep Learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition. 4.NLP:  NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, it is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.\"], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'ETA Prediction', 'patterns': ['How machine learning helps in ETA prediction', 'How ETA Prediction is done using ML', 'Role of machine learning in calculation of  estimated time of arrival prediction'], 'responses': ['ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) prediction is an appealing feature commonly used in logistics company for an enhanced customer experience.

The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'Market Analysis', 'patterns': ['How Machine learning helps in boosting the marketing strategies of a product', 'How machine learning helps in analysing the market for a product', 'How machine learning helps in getting customers attention for a product', 'What are the techniques used for market analysis in machine learning'], 'responses': ['Marketing success depends on many factors.

Regressions models for dynamic pricing:  Regression techniques in Machine Learning allow marketers to predict numerical values based on pre-existing features, which in turn optimizes the different aspects of the customer journey. Regression techniques also helps in sales forecasting and in optimizing marketing spend. 3.)Text extraction and summarization for trending news:  Marketers can leverage ML to extract relevant content from online news articles and other data sources to determine how people view their brand and or react to their products.

AI is being used in multiple places such as Siri, Google's AlphaGo, AI in Chess playing, etc. Artificial Intelligence applies machine learning, deep learning and other techniques to solve actual problems. 2.Neural Network:A neural network is a kind of machine learning inspired by the workings of the human brain. It’s a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. 3.Deep Learning:  Deep Learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition. 4.NLP:  NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, it is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.\"], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'ETA Prediction', 'patterns': ['How machine learning helps in ETA prediction', 'How ETA Prediction is done using ML', 'Role of machine learning in calculation of  estimated time of arrival prediction'], 'responses': ['ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) prediction is an appealing feature commonly used in logistics company for an enhanced customer experience.

The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'Market Analysis', 'patterns': ['How Machine learning helps in boosting the marketing strategies of a product', 'How machine learning helps in analysing the market for a product', 'How machine learning helps in getting customers attention for a product', 'What are the techniques used for market analysis in machine learning'], 'responses': ['Marketing success depends on many factors.

Regressions models for dynamic pricing:  Regression techniques in Machine Learning allow marketers to predict numerical values based on pre-existing features, which in turn optimizes the different aspects of the customer journey. Regression techniques also helps in sales forecasting and in optimizing marketing spend. 3.)Text extraction and summarization for trending news:  Marketers can leverage ML to extract relevant content from online news articles and other data sources to determine how people view their brand and or react to their products.

The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'Market Analysis', 'patterns': ['How Machine learning helps in boosting the marketing strategies of a product', 'How machine learning helps in analysing the market for a product', 'How machine learning helps in getting customers attention for a product', 'What are the techniques used for market analysis in machine learning'], 'responses': ['Marketing success depends on many factors.

AI is being used in multiple places such as Siri, Google's AlphaGo, AI in Chess playing, etc. Artificial Intelligence applies machine learning, deep learning and other techniques to solve actual problems. 2.Neural Network:A neural network is a kind of machine learning inspired by the workings of the human brain. It’s a computing system made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data. 3.Deep Learning:  Deep Learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition. 4.NLP:  NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, it is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.\"], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'ETA Prediction', 'patterns': ['How machine learning helps in ETA prediction', 'How ETA Prediction is done using ML', 'Role of machine learning in calculation of  estimated time of arrival prediction'], 'responses': ['ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) prediction is an appealing feature commonly used in logistics company for an enhanced customer experience.

The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'Market Analysis', 'patterns': ['How Machine learning helps in boosting the marketing strategies of a product', 'How machine learning helps in analysing the market for a product', 'How machine learning helps in getting customers attention for a product', 'What are the techniques used for market analysis in machine learning'], 'responses': ['Marketing success depends on many factors.

Regressions models for dynamic pricing:  Regression techniques in Machine Learning allow marketers to predict numerical values based on pre-existing features, which in turn optimizes the different aspects of the customer journey. Regression techniques also helps in sales forecasting and in optimizing marketing spend. 3.)Text extraction and summarization for trending news:  Marketers can leverage ML to extract relevant content from online news articles and other data sources to determine how people view their brand and or react to their products.

Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings.

Clustering for customer segmentation and discovery:The algorithms analyze billions of customer’s interests and identify specific customer’s interests based on their social media activities and then generate a visual report grouping people with similar interests. 2.) Regressions models for dynamic pricing:  Regression techniques in Machine Learning allow marketers to predict numerical values based on pre-existing features, which in turn optimizes the different aspects of the customer journey. Regression techniques also helps in sales forecasting and in optimizing marketing spend. 3.)Text extraction and summarization for trending news:  Marketers can leverage ML to extract relevant content from online news articles and other data sources to determine how people view their brand and or react to their products.

Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car.

The hardware collects the data; the software organizes and compiles it. On the software side, the input data will normally be processed through machine learning algorithms or complex lines of code that have been trained in real-world scenarios. Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'], 'context': ['']}, {'tag': 'Market Analysis', 'patterns': ['How Machine learning helps in boosting the marketing strategies of a product', 'How machine learning helps in analysing the market for a product', 'How machine learning helps in getting customers attention for a product', 'What are the techniques used for market analysis in machine learning'], 'responses': ['Marketing success depends on many factors.
